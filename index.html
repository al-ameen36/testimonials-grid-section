                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in
                        the
                        company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                        transition
                        and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                        course
                        and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                        most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                        careers,
                        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                        former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
                        the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                        as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
